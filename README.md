# offcenter_trading_system

This is a parent project that allows all offcenter projects to be built at once.

## Setup

In order to setup this project, the child projects need to be setup as soft links. For Linux this is done as so:
```shell
ln -s ../offcenter_oanda offcenter_oanda
ln -s ../offcenter_common offcenter_common
ln -s ../offcenter_trading offcenter_trading
```

## Roadmap
<strong>Documentation</strong>
1. Create the missing documenation.
2. Add examples.
